Simple and tiny adds Open Graph metadata to your posts and pages so that they look great when shared on sites like Facebook and Google+.

== Description ==

The [Open Graph protocol][] enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.  Most notably, this allows for these pages to be used with Facebook's [Like Button][] and [Graph API][] as well as within [Google+][] posts.

The Open Graph plugin inserts the Open Graph metadata into page head section and provides filters for other plugins and themes to override this data, or to provide additional Open Graph data.

No configuration, pure power.

Plugin grabs data from content and if contains YouTube URL, then plugin try to get movie thumbnail and use it in og:image.

If the post contains YouTube links, this plugin saves as post meta video thumbnail link and add it to og:image as post thumbnail.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure the Open Graph plugin? =

You don't; there's nothing to configure and there is no admin page. By default, it will use whatever standard WordPress data it can to populate the Open Graph data. There are very simple yet powerful filters you can use to modify or extend the metadata returned by the plugin, described below.

* og:image: From a specific custom field of the post/page, or if not set from the post/page featured/thumbnail image, or if it doesn't exist from the first image in the post content, or if it doesn't exist from the first image on the post media gallery, or if it doesn't exist from the default image defined in the options menu. The same image chosen here will be used and enclosure/media:content on the RSS feed.
* og:video - add links to YouTube movies.

= I installed OG and ... nothing happens! =

Please be patient, sometimes you need more a day to see results. The reason of this is cache on Facebook. But check your plugins too and if you use and caching plugins, try to do "flush cache" on your site.

= How to filter values? =

Use auto filters. If you have value like this:

    <meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Trunk" />

Then auto filter is created like this:

og_ + (word before ":") + _ + (word after ":") + _value

In this case:

og_og_title_value

    add_filter('og_og_title_value', 'my_og_og_title_value');
    function my_og_og_title_value($title)
    {
        if ( is_home() ) {
            return __('This is extra home title!', 'translate-domain');
        }
        return $title;
    }

= How to filter whole meta tag? =

Use auto filters. If you have value like this:

    <meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Trunk" />

Then auto filter is created like this:

og_ + (word before ":") + _ + (word after ":") + _meta

In this case:

og_og_title_meta

    add_filter('og_og_title_meta', 'my_og_og_title_meta');
    function my_og_og_title_meta($title)
    {
        if ( is_home() ) {
            return '<meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Title" />';
        }
        return $title;
    }

= How to setup default image? =

Use filter "og_image_init":

    add_filter('og_image_init', 'my_og_image_init');
    function my_og_image_init($images)
    {
        if ( is_front_page() || is_home() ) {
            $images[] = 'http://wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCN0570.jpg';
        }
        return $images;
    }

= How to setup image on the front page? =

Use filter "og_image_init":

    add_filter('og_og_image_value', 'my_og_og_image_value');
    function my_og_og_image_value($images)
    {
        if ( empty($images) ) {
            $images[] = 'http://wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCN0570.jpg';
        }
        return $images;
    }

= How to add Facebook app_id? =

OG plugin is super simple and we do not plan to add any "options page" which is needed if you want to have data like "fb:app_id" or "fb:pages".

But, if you really wanna use OG and serve "FB" OpenGraph tags, then you can use `og_array` filter to add (or modify) OpenGraph tags.

    add_filter( 'og_array', 'add_og_facebook_data' );
    function add_og_facebook_data( $og ) {
        $og['fb'] = array(
            'app_id' => 'my-app-id',
            'pages' => 'foo, bar',
        );
        return $og;
    }
