Comprehensive JSON-LD based Structured Data solution for WordPress for adding schema for organizations, businesses, blog posts, ratings & more.

== Description ==

Structured data and schema are becoming more and more important for search engine optimization. The bad news is that this is pretty complicated stuff and even the most seasoned SEO specialists struggle with the proper implementation of structured data and schema.  The good news is that we have created the WordPress SEO Structured Data Schema plugin which enables web designers and business owners a super-easy way to add schema for:

* Organizations
* Local Businesses
* Articles
* Blog Postings
* Events
* Products
* Videos
* Services
* Ratings

We created this plugin after trying dozens of free and premium schema and rich snippet plugins for WordPress. There are some great ones out there for specific kinds of content, but we could not find an easy-to-use, comprehensive JSON-LD plugin that provided features that most business websites need.
So we made our own.

= What is Structured Data & Schema? =
Structured data adds context to your website content by way of using standardized search engine “vocabulary” at Schema.org.  When implemented correctly, structured data increases the chances that search engines like Google will show additional information about your content directly in the search engine results pages (aka SERPs) via “rich snippets”.  In other words, if you are searching for a WordPress rich snippet plugin, this may be the one you are looking for….

= What is a Rich Snippet? =
Rich snippets are the extra information that you often see right in the search results, such as:

* Star ratings
* Events and event times
* Embedded site search box
* Videos
* Breadcrumbs

In other words, rich snippets are the visible result of structured data that appears in the SERPs.

= Does Structured Data Help With SEO? =
Absolutely!  There is no question that structured data that produces rich snippet “bling” that improves SERP click through rates (CTR).   Virtually every search engine expert on the planet will tell you that organic click through rates are a major search engine optimization ranking factor.  This, structured data has a very high correlation (ie indirect relationship) with search engine rankings.

Is there a direct effect on SEO?  Maybe.  Recent communication from Google indicates that [structured data may become a direct ranking factor in the near future](http://searchengineland.com/google-may-add-structured-markup-data-to-ranking-algorithm-230402).

HOWEVER…as with all things on the Internet, it garbage in, garbage out.  Just installing this plugin will not do anything for your website unless you use it correctly, and properly and accurately configure the data.

= Why JSON-LD? =
In summary, there are three structured data formats:

* **MicroData** (HTML based)
* **RFDa** (HTML based)
* **JSON-LD** (Java Script based)

We used JSON-LD for many reasons.  For one, JSON is less invasive from a coding standpoint.  Second, Google can read JSON-LD data that is dynamically injected from Javascript code and embedded widgets. In layman’s terms, JSON is the latest and greatest…it’s where structured data is headed and in our opinion, it should be used to implement structured data on all WordPress websites.
